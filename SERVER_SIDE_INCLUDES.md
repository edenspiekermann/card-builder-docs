# Setting up server side includes using ESI

In this short documentation, you will learn how to use our Edge Side Includes (ESI) setup to include Card Builder stacks on your website.

## ESI Endpoints

To implement card stacks on your site using server side includes please use the following structure. You have a unique card stack base URL, or maybe even more than one if you have a separate advertising account, this will be something like http://yourname.cards.edenspiekermann.com – and all the paths that follow are based on this.

### ESI Head

This contains styles, and sprites. Should be included in the head of the article.

```
/stacks/esi/head
```

Optional: Add a ‘static=true’ parameter to always render the stacks in a narrow layout (not adapting to screen size)

```
/stacks/esi/head?static=true
```

#### ESI Head with Meta

This contains styles, and sprites. Should be included in the head of the article. This also contains meta tags for title, image and description. This should be included instead of the head when the article has been shared from the card stack using the shareUrl parameter (see: [Passing a custom sharing URL](#passing-a-custom-sharing-url)).

```
/stacks/:id/esi/head
```

Optional: add a ‘static=true’ parameter to always render the stacks in a narrow layout (not adapting to screen size)

```
/stacks/:id/esi/head?static=true
```

### ESI Body

The main body of the stack, insert this where the stack should appear in the article. For each stack you wish to embed, include:

```
/stacks/:id/esi/body
```

Optional: Add a ‘static=true’ parameter to always render the stacks in a narrow layout (not adapting to screen size)

```
/stacks/:id/esi/body?static=true
```

### ESI Scripts

Include this once pr page. For performance reasons, we suggest putting this at the end of your page, after your scripts.

```
/stacks/esi/scripts
```

## Passing a custom sharing URL

By default the stack will share the current page it’s being displayed on. This is mostly just a fallback option and isn’t the prefered way of sharing. There should also be a share URL set in the admin area of the stack – this is where the stack lives permanently on the parent site. This is especially useful when the user get’s to the stack by browsing related stacks, and wants to share this specific stack.

As well as this a custom share URL parameter can be added to the Body ESI URL. This can have something like campaign tracking parameters, which should be fired when the stack is shared.

```
http://name.cards.edenspiekermann.com/stacks/:id/esi/body?shareUrl=http://url.com?param=true
```

## Passing a custom sharing URL-Suffix

Instead of passing a whole sharing URL, you can pass in a sharing URL suffix which will be added to the sharing URL stored in the cards backend. This could be used for URL dispatching or tracking parameters.

The `shareUrlQuerySuffix` should be URL-encoded.

```
http://name.cards.edenspiekermann.com/stacks/:id/esi/body?shareUrlQuerySuffix=your-custom%3Dshare-suffix
```

This will result in:

```
http://[your-cards-domain]/stacks/:id/esi/body?your-custom=share-suffix#s-356a19-226
```

where `s-356a19-226` is the CSS ID of the stack to be shared.
